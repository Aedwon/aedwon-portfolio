# The Living Lab Portfolio

The Living Lab is a dynamic, multi-theme portfolio website designed and built by Aedwon. It showcases web development and community system expertise through three distinct interactive themes, allowing users to experience the content in completely different visual contexts.

## Features

### Dynamic Theme System
The core feature of this application is its ability to instantly switch between three fully realized design systems.

*   **Minimalist**: A clean, white-space dominant design focusing on professional typography and subtle interactions. Perfect for stakeholders who value clarity and directness.
*   **Neubrutalist**: A bold, high-contrast aesthetic featuring hard borders, stark shadows, and vibrant colors. Ideally suited for creative agencies and modern web apps.
*   **DiscordOS**: A pixel-perfect recreation of the Discord user interface. This theme transforms the portfolio into a familiar chat application, complete with server navigation, channel lists, and message-style content.

### Interactive Components
*   **Hero Section**: Features immediate-load text and impactful calls to action.
*   **Project Showcase**: Detailed cards with problem-solution-result breakdowns.
*   **Community Dashboard**: A data-visualization component demonstrating analytics capabilities.
*   **Contact Form**: A functional input simulation styled to match the active theme.

## Technology Stack

This project is built with a modern, performance-focused stack.

*   **Framework**: Next.js (App Router)
*   **Language**: TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
*   **Animations**: Framer Motion
